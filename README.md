# TodoAppCompose

Overview

TodoApp is a comprehensive task management application that provides users with a seamless experience to add, view, and manage their tasks, ensuring that no important task is missed.

This App is built on Jetpack Compose using MaterialDesign guideline and it uses a single activity and zero fragment pattern.

On top of that, this app also uses Database, DAO, PreferencesDataStore and Dependency Injection (Dagger and Hilt).

The app is still on development, I wanna try to create login via Firebase Auth and Database so that the users can save their own schedules and tasks but unfortunately I'm still busy.
